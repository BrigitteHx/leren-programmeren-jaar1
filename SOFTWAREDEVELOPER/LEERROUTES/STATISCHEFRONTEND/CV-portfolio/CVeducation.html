			<p><li>2022 - Ongoing, MBO Software Developer at DaVinci College Dordecht;</li>
            </p>
            <p>I am currently following the Software Developer course at the DaVinci College in Dordrecht (vocational education), I plan to graduate in 2-3 years. After my current study I plan to go to HBO (bachelor degree/ pre-university) and specialize in cybersecurity.

            <p><li>2017 - 2022 HAVO at Dalton Lyceum Barendrecht;</li>
            </p>
            <p>I followed HAVO (high school) classes at the Dalton Lyceum in Barendrecht for 5 years. I completed this study up to and including grade 4, after which I went to MBO. I also took an extra French and English course there, the extra effort has left me with almost fluent English and decent French.
