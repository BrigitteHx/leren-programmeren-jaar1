			<p>Im a student who likes to learn and collaborate. As developers, we face new challenges and obstacles every day, forcing us to work harder than ever. I am always looking for new challenges and resources to help, not only myself but also others to improve their performance in their work.
            </p>
            <p>In my free time I like to spend time with friends and family. I also like to do sports such as horseback riding and I also enjoy reading, its my favorite hobby! Another thing I really enjoy is travelling, I've seen quite a lot of Europe already and hope to see more in the future.
            </p>
